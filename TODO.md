- Work out why the game freezes when closing.
  - Attempt to fix this.
- Check for bugs and fix.
  - Test on different operating systems.
    - Currently, we've only tested Windows.
    - Testing all the dialog themes would also be desired as we should disable any that don't work with the os (shouldn't be any issues, but you never know.)
  - Occasional game crash when loading?
    - Is this with the saved file, or just random?
    - Can't close game normally. (Not our issue but will try to fix)
      - Is this an LWJGL issue?
